## Hey There | Bonjour | Xin ChÃ o! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my corner of the world! Iâ€™m a Supply Chain Management enthusiast with a knack for data analysis and a passion for swimming, sports, and all things active. What I do? I love turning raw numbers into actionable strategies by utilizing tech tools Python (pandas, numpy), SQL, Excel (pivot tables & beyond), Power BI    to make supply chains faster, smarter, and more efficient. From forecasting demand to optimizing production , keeping goods moving as smoothly as I move through water
