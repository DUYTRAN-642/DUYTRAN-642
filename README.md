## Hey There | Bonjour | Xin Chào! 👋

Welcome to my corner of the world! I’m a Supply Chain Management enthusiast with a knack for data analysis and a passion for swimming, sports, and all things active. What I do? I love turning raw numbers into actionable strategies by utilizing tech tools Python (pandas, numpy), SQL, Excel (pivot tables & beyond), Power BI    to make supply chains faster, smarter, and more efficient. From forecasting demand to optimizing production , keeping goods moving as smoothly as I move through water.

⚡ Beyond the desk, When I’m not dissecting supply chain datasets, you’ll find me in the pool :flying_disc:, cheering at a game, or training for my next challenge :medal_sports:
